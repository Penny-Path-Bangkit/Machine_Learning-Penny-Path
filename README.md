# Project Overview

The objective of this project is to develop a model that accurately tracks and categorizes students' income and spending behavior. This model will help students manage their budgets effectively by providing detailed financial recaps, identifying unusual spending patterns, and offering savings recommendations. By incorporating features such as anomaly detection and personalized saving goals, the model aims to guide students toward better financial decisions, ultimately contributing to more sustainable financial habits. This system can be integrated into an app, allowing users to easily monitor and optimize their financial health based on real-time data.

# Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of financial records from students, including details on income and expenses Each data entry is labeled with relevant financial categories (e.g., monthly income, spending types). This data allows the model to categorize and analyze students' financial behaviors, identify patterns, and offer personalized suggestions for managing their budgets effectively.
